# Learning Activities & Resources
The teaching materials for this course are still provided by the teacher. I learned some basic knowledge and commands of PHP from the PPT in the class and the videos played by the teacher.

# Estimated Hours
Because I just simply wrote a little basic code, I didnâ€™t waste too much time. It only took **1** hour.

# Content Insights
PHP code is closely related to HTML. If you don't learn PHP, you won't be able to use HTML to obtain information.

# Career/Employability/Learning Insights
For the future assessment 2, the PHP I learned this time is a very important course.
