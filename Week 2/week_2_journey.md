# Learning Activities & Resources
This task makes me very confused, because it is not at the same level as what I learned last week. For myself, I can't keep up with this progress very well. The best I can do is build a template website.

# Estimated Hours
This week had me confused from the beginning and took me 2 days.
Goals of this assignment:
Set up Joomla environment→Apply template→Export Joomla from local host→Upload to cloud server


# Content Insights
This exercise not only requires learning the language of SQL, but also understanding the difference between the front-end and the back-end. Compared with last week, I feel that I have taken too big a step and I have not kept up.

# Career/Employability/Learning Insights
In order to complete this week's exercises, I tried my best to search for relevant information from major websites. But this only took me to the step of setting up the website and local server. I didn't quite understand the subsequent back-end content.
