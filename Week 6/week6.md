# Learning Activities & Resources
The purpose of this class is to teach us how to use Slack and use Slack to connect the group's Github repository and Trello.
These two tutorials are already provided in the software user interface, so I did not look for external teaching materials.

# Estimated Hours
For me, it's not too difficult. It took me about **half an hour** to figure out how to connect. 
Since this was a team assignment, it took me more time to help others understand, maybe **1** hour.

# Content Insights
Only one software is needed to cover most of the resources used to complete the task, greatly saving work time.

# Career/Employability/Learning Insights
Slack is not only a full-featured chat software, but it also has the function of connecting work resources.
That means you donâ€™t need to open them, just a Slack to do it all.
