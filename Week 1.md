# Learning Activities & Resources
Because I found that most tutorials online cost money, and tutorials using text are not very intuitive. I chose to get html-related tutorials from ChatGPT. The specific operation was to ask him about html-related knowledge.

# Estimated Hours
Most of the main work is completed in **1 hour**, the previous study took **2 hours**.

# Content Insights
Use some simple html code to write 3 interconnected web pages, upload it to Github and create an online web page using Github Page.
"index.html" means that the homepage also contains a welcome picture.
"product.html" contains pictures of some products (assuming the company sells aquatic products)
"contact.html" contains a fictitious contact information and address, corresponding to the real contact information and address.

# Career/Employability/Learning Insights
I haven't spent money to use online tutorials, so I don't know exactly how they instruct. My opinion on using ChatGPT this time is to learn to draw inferences from one example. ChatGPT provides you with a piece of code, and you have to use this code to deal with other situations and learn to use these codes. Directly copying it will only make this memory disappear from the mind quickly, making it impossible to effectively learn knowledge. At the same time, I also found that ChatGPT's response method was too comprehensive, and I could not obtain relevant knowledge through my own deduction. Although learning through this method was fast and convenient, the learning results were not as good as through normal channels.
